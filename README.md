## 🚀 Overview

This project is a lightweight compiler developed using C++ that parses and evaluates basic arithmetic expressions. It encapsulates the core phases of compilation—lexical analysis, parsing (via recursive descent), AST construction, and expression evaluation.

It was created to demonstrate essential compiler design principles in an educational and modular format as part of a 4-week internship at CodTech IT Solutions.
